    "body": "I recently, briefly went back to Pokemon Shield and it\u2019s extremely noticeable how much better everything looks. \n\nLike sure, it\u2019s by no means the best looking game out there, not even close, but the environments generally have way more design to them, the towns naturally point you towards good angles, NPCs are better designed and the gym leaders are all enjoyable and, perhaps controversially, the music is much better.\n\nI can extend this to legends arceus, too. The skyboxes in that game are incre..."

But the second the mask came off in the DLC cutscene, I realized that I would literally die for this child. It is physically impossible for me to not love that face. The little fangs and star pupils are really simplistic, but work so goddamn well. I feel like I'm losing my mi..."

Real annoying ones that evolve in convoluted ways, like trading etc.\n\nAs im going through my Home, I noticed that Rayquaza was transferable into Violet. I thought \"Why not.\" Now if you are familiar with the move V-Create, you will know that it is a event only move. In other words, you will never be able to get V-..."

I've been putting a lot of thought into what game I should get and I'm torn between, The Sword and Shield titles and the Scarlet and Violet titles. SV looks a lot more buggy yet more fun and unique, ShSh looks like more of a classic Pokemon game, but seems to run far better. So because I can't make my own decision, I'd like to ask the community...."

And apparently it has some sort of electric based super sixth sense with which it hunts!\n\nEven if Psyduck was loosely based on a Platypus, they could come up with a better one based on its true characteristics.\n\nType: Water, Poison, Electric?..."
